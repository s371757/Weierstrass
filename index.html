                        He was a hedgehog. We are mathematicians. Every day we saw him while driving home from the office.

                        He was brutally murdered on 31.05.2025, too soon, by a car on the road. We will revenge him.

                        Though your quills are now still and your snuffles silent, your spirit remains bright in our memories.
                        Thank you for the quiet companionship, the unconditional love, and the countless moments of joy you brought into our lives.
                        You were more than just a pet; you were family.
