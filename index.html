        <div class="content-box">
          <p>
            Weierstrass came into our lives on <strong>[Month, Year/Story of
            how you met]</strong> and instantly filled our home with
            <em>curious snuffles</em>, <em>quiet joy</em>, and an
            <em>adventurous spirit</em>. He/She was a hedgehog with a truly
            unique personality – surprisingly cuddly for a creature of quills, a
            determined explorer of every nook and cranny, and a connoisseur of
            the finest mealworms.
          </p>
          <p>
            His/Her favorite things included <strong>napping in that fluffy
            sack</strong>, <strong>running on the wheel at 3 AM</strong>, the
            taste of <strong>fresh blueberries</strong>, and
            <strong>sunbathing in a warm spot</strong>. We’ll always remember
            the funny way he/she would huff when dinner was late, or the
            adorable sleepy stretches after a long nap.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every day with Weierstrass was a small adventure, a gentle reminder
            of life’s simple joys. His name, inspired by the intricate function
            in mathematics, perfectly fit his wonderfully complex little self.

          <p>
            One evening, we couldn't find Weierstrass anywhere! After a frantic
            search, we discovered him hiding under the sofa cushions—just
            peeking out with that mischievous sparkle in his eye. It was a
            perfect example of his curious and adventurous spirit. We still
            smile thinking about it.

        <div class="story-box">
          <h3 class="story-title">Mealworm Joy</h3>
          <p>
            Nothing made Weierstrass happier than the sound of the mealworm
            bag. He would pop his head out, wiggle his nose, and make little
            happy noises. It was such a small thing, but it brought so much
            joy to watch.

            Though your quills are now still and your snuffles silent, your
            spirit remains bright in our memories. Thank you for the quiet
            companionship, the unconditional love, and the countless moments
            of joy you brought into our lives. You were more than just a pet; you
            were family.
